Now to all those who can't put 2 and 2 together from the readme.. here is a
big speel about how E is configured via themeballs, and what exactly a
themeball is. E comed out of the box wiht 2 themeballs in
/usr/local/enlightenment/themes. you can shose any theme by:
enlightenment -theme theme_ball_file
by default if E is given NO theme to use.. it looks for a themeball called
DEFAULT in /usr/local/enlightenment/themes (or wherever you installed
Enlightenment)

A "themeball" can be on of 3 formats:
a .tar.gz file
a .tar file
a directory containing the contents of the theme.. 
so the tarball has the following contents:

if its a tar.gz themeball:

> tar ztf /usr/local/enlightenment/DEFAULT
MAIN
buttons
cursors
exec
fx
icons
infobox
menus
pix/
pix/icon_term_2.ppm
pix/icon_term_1.ppm
pix/icon_term_3.ppm
etc.....

if its a vanilla tar themeball:

> tar tf /usr/local/enlightenment/DEFAULT
MAIN
buttons
cursors
exec
fx
icons
infobox
menus
pix/
pix/icon_term_2.ppm
pix/icon_term_1.ppm
pix/icon_term_3.ppm
pix/iconbox_arrow1_1.ppm
pix/iconbox_arrow2_1.ppm
pix/iconbox_bg.ppm
etc.

if it is a directoy themeball:

> ls
/usr/local/enlightenment/themes/DEFAULTtotal 69
1 ./      1 cursors  2 infobox  2 status
1 ../     1 exec    27 menus    1 text
3 MAIN    1 fx       2 pix/    15 windowstyles
7 buttons 4 icons    1 root

its as simlpe as that! you can keep the themeball unzipped, but tarred
for neatness, or keep it untarred in a directry.. or tarred and gzipped. Its 
your choice. I distribute themeballs tarred & gzipped. If you ever make a 
theme and want to release it.. the advantage is you can just release your 
themeball as-is (tar & gzip up the direcoty, or just gzip yer theme tar.. or 
just upload the .tar.gz themeball as is if u work on it in that fashion as i 
do)... its that simple. E by default if not told to use a theme will first
look for the DEFAULT themeball mentions above.. and the it looks for config 
files in .enlightenemnt. the config files or data files in here should
correspond to the equivalents in the theme (eg MAIN, buttons, or files like
pix.button.ppm etc.). These override any of the corresponding files in the
theme.. so a user can select hsi favorite theme stored on hsimachine.. and
copy just the fiels he wishes to change from the default to his
.enlightenment dir and edit them.. if he doesn like an icon.. just make a
replacement in the same position in .enlightnement (like
.enlightnement/pix/button.ppm will override the image pix/button.ppm in the
theme). If E cant find a themeball it it tries 
/usr/local/enlightenent/system_config as it did before for config files.. 
these are not interpreted as themeball files.. but require full paths to 
images.. these are last-resort config files setup by system admin if
all-else fails.. if this fails.. E bails out and wont load.

Now I hope that clears it all up once and for all. I have given you all
you need to make thngs like theme managers that run before E runs that
can choose and manage installed and user owned themeballs.. and to
select them etc. Thsi isnt E's task. the hooks are there. Use
them. If a theme manager doesnt appear in the near future.. i prolly will write
one myself.... this is where phase 2 for themeballs comes in:

a theme manager would, (liek E). look inside themeballs for lets say a
certain file (called lets say for now THEME)... This is a text file that 
maybe looks like this:

TITLE: Default Enlgihtenment Theme 
RELEASE: Sat Jun 28 00:38:40 1997
AUTHOR: The Rasterman
LICENCE: COPYRIGHT 1997, GPL License
DESCRIPTION: This is the default theme
provided with Enlightenment. It
isn't as fast or efficient as could be, but is designed to
show off as many features of Enlightenment as possible.
E-VERSION: Required Minimum - Enlightenment 1.0 Thebes DR-0.10
BANNER: info/banner.ppm
THUMBNAIL: info/thumbnail.ppm

that would be a sample file.. the theme manager would read and interpret. It 
could provide a list of themes form a directory.. or a config file.. and from 
this THEME info file display the title, author, description etc. in a gui... 
and then also show a scaled down image fo a screenshot of the theme running 
(the thumbanil) to give people an idea of what it looks like, and a banner 
image to use as a title icon/banner/marker for the theme.

these files are created byt he theme maker basically to provide more info, 
and to advertise themselves. This is my current idea.. but this isnt part of 
Enlightenment directly. This would be the tast of a "helper" app.. like a 
theme manager. Any of you buddign coders out there who knoe a decent amount 
on how to code for X.. and maybe use imlib (you would need to to load up the 
thumbnails and banner images at any rate..).. this could be a small good 
project to start. :)

Now happy Playing with your new environment!
