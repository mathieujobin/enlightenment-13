Preliminary CDE Support
-----------------------

	A while back, the big industry leaders in UNIX decided that
they needed a standard desktop in order to compete with YouKnowWho.
The product that has been born out of that consortium is called
the Common Desktop Environment, or CDE for short.  CDE, in and
of itself, is quite powerful allowing you to do things like 
drag-n-drop across platforms all within the X interface.... However.

	The big nightmare with CDE is that it is almost *TOO* 
configurable--your typical System Administrator can quickly get
lost in the various resource files that control this and control
that.  Ask anyone who has attempted to add Enlightenment to the
list of available "sessions."

	In order to help out, I've decided to add what I've been 
using for a while to the general distribution.  Needless to say
it more or less works for me, but Your Mileage May Vary.  Inside this
directory, you'll find the following:

	mk_dt_e            --	/usr/dt/config Xresource builder

	mk_dt_e.pre        --	same script, before site 
                                customizations are made via imake

	Xsession.patch     --	context diff to make Xsession.enl

	Xsession.patch.pre --   context diff, before site 
                                customizations

	icons              --	directory full of logos for the
				dtlogin window
		
	If you haven't done so yet, compile enlightement so that
you have the mk_dt_e script and the Xsession.patch file.  Change
the permissions on the mk_dt_e script:

	chmod 4755 mk_dt_e
	chown root mk_dt_e

[Yes, it runs as setuid root so that anyone can execute it.  This
is more for convience than purpose.]

	Execute this script.  It should build several directories
and a bunch 'o files and links in /etc/dt.  Copy this script to
wherever enlightenment lives (/usr/local/enlightenment/bin, usually)
and add an entry into your crontab to call this script as many times
as you feel necessary.  

	Next, grab a copy of your /usr/dt/bin/Xsession file.  For
most OSes, this has been written so that your OS specific stuff is
surrounded by gobs of spaces where the *OTHER* platform specific
stuff is hiding at.  If luck is on your side, youould be able to
just use patch to create a new file:

	patch < Xsession.patch

	... or something similar.  If patch doesn't work, then
you can try hand-modifying it.  There isn't that much that needs
to be changed, but... Anyway, call the patched Xsession file
Xsession.enl.  Copy this file to /etc/dt/config.  Change the
permissions:  

	chmod 0755 /etc/dt/config/Xsession.enl
	chown root /etc/dt/config/Xsession.enl

	Now, copy the contents of the icons/ directory from
here to ENLIGHTENMENTROOT/dt/icons.   These work *just* like
CDE's normal logos: 237x237 in either xpm or xbm format. 
Filenames are in the form: THEMENAME_logo.pm or 
THEMENAME_logo.bm.

	Once you have done all this, log in via dtlogin.  You
should be pleasantly surprised. =)

***SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING LOCALES***


	While CDE itself supports multple locales, alas, the
current script doesn't doesn't take these into account.  The only
change that needs to be made, really, is in mk_dt_e.  Change
all of the C locale entries to the locale of your choice.  In theory,
this should enable you to have locale support and theme support.

	To be honest, I haven't tested this. =)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Technical details:

	Basically, we are taking advantage of a feature of CDE:
namely, user customizations can go in /etc/dt without affecting
the rest of the system.  The resource files that are built are
modeled after the ones that come with Solaris that launch the
OpenWindows environment under CDE.  As you can see, there isn't
really that much that is special here.	

	Xsession.enl is modified so that it can take a theme
parameter as well as starting up enlightenment rather than starting
up whatever is mentioned as the alternate manager.  Also, all mentions
of dthello are wiped out (usually screws up the color scheme on
E's bootup) and all mentions of dtsession are gone--sorry.  dtsession
is what starts up dtwm, and I simply couldn't find a way to make
it listen to what I wanted it do.... This is why this is a preliminary
release.  Hopefully by the time we get to 0.14, this problem will
be licked.

	The logos are done through file system magic, really.  By
linking /etc/dt/appconfig/icons/C/<THEME>_Logo.<type> to their place
in /usr/local/enlightenment/dt/icons, we avoid having to modify
/usr/dt *and* we make it easy for theme authors to provide user's with
a logo.
